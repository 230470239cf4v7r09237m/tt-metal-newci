# TT-Metalium / TT-NN Models

Please refer to the front-page [README](../README.md) for complete lists of
which models work by their platforms.

- [Demo models on Grayskull](../README.md#grayskull-gs-models)
- [Demo models on Wormhole](../README.md#wormhole-wh-models)
- [Demo models on TT-QuietBox & TT-LoudBox (Wormhole)](../README.md#tt-quietbox--tt-loudbox-2x4-mesh-of-whs-models)
- [Demo models on Single Galaxy (Wormhole)](../README.md#single-galaxy-8x4-mesh-of-whs-models)

## Release methodology

- Models that are advertised of part of release usually on the demo models, and are treated as first-class citizens, and therefore tests.
- Model writers are responsible for ensuring their demo model tests are always passing. Any failure is treated highest-priority (or P0) failure.
- Model writers are responsible for advertising which release tag (including release candidates) contains passing tests for their demo models.
- Model writers are responsible for updating their perf metrics for the demo models at a regular cadence. Currently, the cadence is at least every 2 weeks.
