# Sandbox

The purpose of the sandbox directory is to hold anything that is in
development-only.

Nothing in this directory will be shipped on release.

There will be no official development support nor code standards enforced in
this directory. Therefore, nothing in this directory may be pushed into the
production areas of the repo.

If something starts in here and is to be made a real feature, then it needs to
go through the regular development process anyway.
