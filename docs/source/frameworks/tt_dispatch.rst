TT-Dispatch
***********

Overview
========

TT-Dispatch is an upcoming framework that will become a unifying interface to
run models on TT-Metal's first-party developed Tensor and ttDNN libraries.

TT-Dispatch will provide implementations of various models used in production
systems and ongoing efforts of partly-supported models.
