Cleanup
--------

1. transpose xy - rank generalization

2. reverse txs
    - remove old reverse, and update tests
    - update name

3. optimize transposes
- put into seperate file
- test
- generalize for dtx graph

4. collapse_transformations
- works if everything is the same rank - all TXs, all producer and concumer pairs
- 2 options for fix:
            1. make everything the same rank before the collapse begins
                    - traverse all TSx, and all tensor pairs, and shapes.
                    - find the biggest rank
                    - padd all other TPs and shapes to that rank, by adding zeros on the Left
            2. generalize the collapse to be
